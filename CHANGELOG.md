### Version 3.0.0

#### High-Performance Chat

We've made chat run faster, by rebuilding it from the ground up. Everything will look and feel better!

#### New Emote Menu

The emote menu was completely redesigned, it's now divided into providers, emote sets, and even shows emojis! It also got smarter, only loading the images currently in view for much better performance.
