### Version 3.0.0

#### High-Performance Chat

We've made chat run faster, by rebuilding it from the ground up. Everything will look and feel better!

#### New Emote Menu

The emote menu was completely redesigned, it's now divided into providers, emote sets, and even shows emojis! It also got smarter, only loading the images currently in view for much better performance.

#### New Settings Menu

7TV has just gotten much more customizable, check out the new menu and tune all the various settings to your liking!

#### Personal Emotes

7TV Subscribers can now use Personal Emotes in chat! These are emotes that can be used globally, but only by you. Get your own by [subscribing](https://7tv.app/store)!

#### Dynamic Cosmetics

Badges, Paints & Animated Avatars will now update instantly. That's right, no more wait times!

#### Custom Chat Highlights

Set up custom highlights for specific phrases in chat messages, with a color, label, title flash and custom sounds. Use Regular Expressions for even greater control.

#### Tab-Completion Carousel

View matches as you go when using TAB to find emotes!

#### Mod Logs

View recent mod actions with the Mod Logs menu.

#### Much more to come

This is just the beginning! We've rewritten the entire extension with a modular, scalable codebase just waiting to be expanded upon. Expect many new additions to come!
